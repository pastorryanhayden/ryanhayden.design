Thanks for signing up.  You now have access to the prayer meeting handout generator.  

To get you setup, I'm going to need you to do four things:

* Sign Up for an [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) account if you haven't already.
* Click on [this link](https://airtable.com/shrLlJRDcERT0Xgkz/tblegxwgiYKJeMbXF/viwHcrDyPne08A0CQ) and click on the "Copy Base" button on the top right.
* Send me an email at pastorryanhayden@gmail.com with three pieces of information:
    - Your name and church name.
    - Your **Airtable API Key** - found in your account settings.
    - The **"App ID"** of your prayer meeting base. Found by clicking the question mark, then clicking "API Docs", then getting the part of the URL that starts with "app" followed by a bunch of numbers.  (The video explains this.)




> **Not Explained in the Video** - Your church information and logo is changed using the "Church_Info" tab.  Everything should be fairly self-explanatory.

If you send me that information, I'll reply back with the URL where you can access your prayer meeting handout every week.
