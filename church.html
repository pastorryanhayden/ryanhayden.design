<p> <strong>I've never met anyone more passionate about helping smaller churches get a great website than me.</strong> I've been making church websites since 2004, and even started an ambitious company selling template based church websites (sitesfor.church - it's still going, I'm just focusing my attention here.)</p>

<p><em>You have a great thing going on in your church. My job is to help you present that online.</em><br><strong>I will custom design your site to fit your church and meet your needs.</strong></p>


<hr>

<h3 style="text-transform: uppercase; font-weight: bold;">All of the features you could want in a church website.</h3>

<p>Each of my church websites are based on my own custom base theme that includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A home page designed to entice visitors to come to your church.</li> 
<li>Prominently displayed maps, service times, and contact information.</li>
<li>A sermon manager that is easy to update.</li>
<li>Easy event pages and google calendar integration.</li>
<li>A church blog.</li>
<li>Other special pages like a statement of faith, church leadership, photo galleries, etc.</li>  
</ul>

<h3 style="text-transform: uppercase; font-weight: bold;">Ridiculously easy to update.</h3>
<p>My church websites are based on cloud-cannon - a dead simple and yet totally flexible way to run a website.  You'll get things like <strong>Visual Website Editing</strong> and <strong>easy page options.</strong>  You'll have total control over the fonts, photos, and colors on your site.</p>
<p>If you need help, you'll have access to documentation (with plenty of helpful videos) and a way to contact me - both from in your site.</p>
