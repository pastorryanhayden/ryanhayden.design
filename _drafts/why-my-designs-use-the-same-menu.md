If you look at my recent projects, almost all of my recent work uses the same menu pattern: One the top right of the screen you’ll see either the word “MENU”, a hamburger button icon, or both. &nbsp;When you click or tap on that, it will open a drawer from the right side of the screen with links and more information.

I’m planning on using this menu pattern on all of my work going forward for the forseeable future. &nbsp;Here is why:

1. It’s easy

I’m into simplifying things that don’t matter. &nbsp;I’m the kind of guy who buys the the same brand and color of socks and wears them every day (unless I’m wearing a suit.) &nbsp;It’s not that I don’t like colorful socks - they have their place - it’s just I have more important things to do in the morning than decide which socks I want to wear today or try to find a match.

Similarly, by sticking with one menu pattern in my designs, it saves me time (which allows for lower prices) and allows me to focus on more important parts of the design.

Which leads me to the second reason…&nbsp;

2. It let’s the call to action stand out.

On most websites, the menu is the most prominent part of the page. &nbsp;But should it be?&nbsp;

Shouldn’t your call to action (what you want your page visitors to do) and your content take center stage.

By hiding the menu in a drawer - it allows users to focus on the content. &nbsp;We can also use the space that would be taken up by the menu and adding another prominent call to action button. &nbsp;

3. It works great on all screen sizes.

Nowadays, about 65%+ of your website traffic is going to come from a phone. &nbsp;Traditional navigation patterns don’t work on phones. &nbsp;So more and more users are getting used to the navigation being hidden by default anyways.

Rather than creating and maintaining two or three different menus, \*why not make one great one that looks good everywhere?\*

4. It’s gives me a second area to put essential information.

One of the reasons I love the drawer is because it gives you a logical place to put essential information like your phone number and schedule. &nbsp; You can also add branding and even more call to action buttons there. &nbsp;

5. It’s super expandable.

By using accordions or drill downs in my menu lists, you can put a TON of links in menu in a very neat way.
