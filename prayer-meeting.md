## Make Prayer Meeting Handouts Great Again!

Does you church host a weekly prayer meeting?  

If so, do you take prayer requests?  

Do you give people a handout of those prayer requests?  

Many, many, churches (including the one where I serve as pastor) do this - and **it’s a pain in the neck**.  It’s hard to curate a list of prayer requests every week. 

**That’s why I created a prayer list generator for my church.**  

### There are two parts to it:

#### **An airtable database where our prayer requests are tracked and organized.**

#### **A website that creates a printable handout from the data in that database.**

So every Wednesday (when we have our prayer meeting) all I need to do is visit a URL and click `File > Print`.  

### The Benefits are "Yuge!"

* There is almost zero week to week setup.  
* Somebody (usually my wife) takes the prayer requests every week and enters them into Airtable (it also gives us a place to put prayer requests when people call with them) and the handout is ready on Wednesday for our prayer meeting.  
* It’s about as automatic as it could be.

### And I want to set it up for you - for free. 

**This is something that could save you as much as an hour every week of your ministry, and I’m giving it away!**  All I ask in return is that you signup for my email list below so that I can send you weekly church tech tips as well as occasional information about my web design services.

#### Note: This may take a couple days

*Please bear in mind, there is a little setup involved.  It shouldn’t take you more than a few minutes and it will probably take me a few minutes for each church.  But if I get 50 of these in a day, it may take me a couple of days to get to yours.*
