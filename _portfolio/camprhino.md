This was an exciting project!  Missionary Mark Coffey and the team he works with in Port Elizabeth South Africa are trying to start a Christian camp for the poorer Township kids.  They are endeavoring to raise $100,000 in one year for this ministry.

I created the logo, created the website from scratch, integrated an email newsletter, created a dynamic fundraising chart and did a lot of copywriting.
