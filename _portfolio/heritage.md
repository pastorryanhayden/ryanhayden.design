This is a website I created for Heritage Baptist Church in Stokesdale, North Carolina. Â A few of the unique things about this site:

* They put out a monthly PDF newsletter so I created a specific section for uploading that.
* The pastor wanted to upload PDF versions of his sermon manuscript so I edited the sermon plugin to make that work.
