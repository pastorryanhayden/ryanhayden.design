title: Affordable Websites for Missionaries
---


## I create websites for missionaries that help them accomplish their God-given calling.
### I’ll make you a custom website that:

- Presents you and your mission well.
- Helps you get more deputation meetings and ministry donations
- Is easy to update with monthly updates, photos, etc.

<br>

### The best part - you can afford it!

**Don’t waste your time and money.** *God has called you to go - but first you have to raise support, and in today’s world, that means you need promotional materials.*  You could do it yourself, but that would require countless hours learning about web design, setting up a host, purchasing a domain name, and you could still get it wrong.  In other words, it could be a waste of your valuable *time*.  Traditional Web firms (if they will work with missionaries and church planters) will charge you thousands for design, which could be a huge waste of *money*.

That’s where we come in.  For an affordable one time fee you get:


- A professionally designed website set up for you.
- Web hosting for three years (the typical length of deputation). 

In other words, you get the main tool that you need to present your ministry well online for the one time fee of $500.
